    <h4>Cinnamon Bread taken from Dollywood</h4>
    <p>Originally, the world-famous cinnamon bread was only available at the Grist Mill where it's topped with icing or hot apple butter. when the COVID-19 pandemic began, and Dollywood's doors closed, now you can make Dollywood's mouthwatering cinnamon bread at home anytime. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water (100 to 110 degrees F, or 40 to 45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon plus a pinch white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Glaze</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>Pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 to 5 tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine warm water, yeast, and a pinch white sugar in a small bowl and whisk. Then let it sit until foamy, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a stand mixer, whisk bread flour, remaining 1 tablespoon white sugar, salt, and melted butter.</li>
        <li>Once yeast mixture is foamy, add it to the stand mixer.</li>
        <li>Using the dough hook, knead on medium speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough ball to a lightly greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place (about 75 to 80 degrees F, or 25 degrees C) until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Punch it down, then transfer dough to a work surface and knead a few times. Cut it in half and gently shape into two 3x6-inch loaves (be careful not to overwork the dough).</li>
        <li>Place the loaves on a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until puffy, about 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Make the topping by whisking white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small baking dish. Whisk melted butter and corn syrup in a separate small baking dish.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and line two 9x5-inch loaf pans with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on both sides.</li>
        <li>Cut four deep slashes across the top of each loaf (the loaves will deflate).</li>
        <li>Dip each loaf in the butter-corn syrup mixture, coating it completely, then coat with the cinnamon-sugar mixture, making sure the mixtures get in all the crevices.</li>
        <li>Place loaves in prepared loaf pans and drizzle with any remaining butter and cinnamon sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lift the bread out of the loaf pans and let cool, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the glaze by whisking confectioners' sugar, salt, melted butter, and 3 tablespoons milk in a bowl until smooth. Whisk in up to 2 more tablespoons milk, if needed to thin out the glaze.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the glaze on the warm loaves or serve on the side for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
